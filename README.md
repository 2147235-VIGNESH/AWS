Question 1: Connecting MongoDB and CRUD Operations 

How would you establish a connection between an AWS Lambda function and a MongoDB database? Provide the necessary configuration steps and code snippets. Assume you have a MongoDB database with a collection named "test-data." Write a sample AWS Lambda function (using Node.js) that performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the "test-data" collection. Include error handling in your code. 

 

Question 2: Creating Pre-Signed URLs for S3 Operations 

How would you generate a pre-signed URL for both uploading and downloading files from an S3 bucket using the AWS SDK in a serverless environment? Include relevant code snippets for generating these pre-signed URLs and highlight any security considerations. 

 

Question 3: Writing serverless.yml for Deployment 

Write a sample serverless.yml file for deploying the AWS Lambda functions created in Question 1 and Question 2 via AWS API Gateway. Include the necessary configuration for integrating the Lambda functions with the API Gateway, specifying the HTTP methods, and defining the resource paths. Ensure that the deployment also includes any required IAM roles or permissions for accessing MongoDB and S3.
